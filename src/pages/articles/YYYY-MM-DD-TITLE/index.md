### Title

Redesigns are more fun than a kitten that swallowed a squeaky ball for [Fr. Chris Decker](https://www.fatherchrisdecker.com/). Not so much for me. I haven't made any meaningful changes to my blog in about two years and I wouldn't have done without some coercion.

In about five weeks, I'll be flying to Europe to spend three solid months on pilgrimage. I'll be hiking the [Camino de Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago). I'll be visiting some of the great Churches of Europe. And I'll be taking quite a lot of time for prayer and for asking the questions that tend to get lost in the busyness of being a priest for Jesus Christ.
